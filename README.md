## Prerequisites

### Osaurus - Local LLM Server

Tweaks requires [Osaurus](https://github.com/dinoki-ai/osaurus), a native Apple Silicon local LLM server, to provide AI-powered text improvements. Osaurus is built on Apple's MLX for maximum performance on M-series chips.

#### Installation

Install Osaurus using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install osaurus
```

#### Setup

1. **Launch Osaurus**: After installation, launch Osaurus from your Applications folder or by running:

   ```bash
   osaurus
   ```

2. **Download a Model**:

   - Click on the Osaurus menu bar icon
   - Go to "Model Gallery" or "Downloads"
   - Choose a model. We recommend: ðŸ‘‰ `gemma-3n-E4B-it-lm-4bit` on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-3n-E4B-it-lm-4bit)
   - Click "Download" and wait for it to complete

3. **Verify it's Running**:
   - Osaurus runs on `http://localhost:1337` by default
   - You should see the Osaurus icon in your menu bar when it's active
4. **Test the API** (optional):
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct-4bit",
       "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]
     }'
   ```

> **Note**: Osaurus requires Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 chips). Intel Macs are not supported.

## Installation

download the latest `.dmg`

Drag into Applications, launch, and press Control + T to open the Quick Actions HUD.

## Development & Debugging

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `tweaks.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

### Quick Start for Debug Builds

Every time you build in debug mode, macOS treats it as a new app that needs accessibility permissions. We've included tools to make this process easier.

#### Method 1: Using the Debug Tab (Recommended)

1. **Run the app** from Xcode
2. **Click the menu bar icon** (gear icon)
3. **Go to Debug tab**
4. **Click "Setup Accessibility"** button
   - This automatically opens System Settings and copies the app path
5. **In System Settings:**
   - Click the "+" button
   - Press Cmd+V to paste the path
   - Select the app and click "Open"
   - Toggle the switch ON

#### Method 2: Using the Debug Script

1. **Run the app** from Xcode
2. **Click the menu bar icon** (gear icon)
3. **Go to Debug tab**
4. **Click "Debug Script"**
   - This creates and runs a Terminal script that guides you through the process

#### Method 3: Manual Process

1. Find your debug build location:
   ```
   ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/tweaks-*/Build/Products/Debug/tweaks.app
   ```
2. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
3. Remove any old "tweaks" entries with "-" button
4. Click "+" and navigate to the path above
5. Toggle ON

### Visual Feedback System

The app includes comprehensive feedback for debugging:

1. **Permission Status Indicator**

   - Green checkmark = Ready to use
   - Orange warning = Permission needed
   - Red X = Permission denied

2. **Hotkey Test Feature**

   - Main tab shows "Test Hotkey Now" button when permissions are granted
   - Press count and last press time are displayed
   - Visual indicator pulses when hotkey is triggered
   - Toast notification appears in bottom-right corner

3. **Debug Build Detection**
   - Automatically detects when running from Xcode
   - Shows special debug helper UI
   - Provides one-click setup process

### Development Tips

1. **Keep the Debug tab open** during development for quick access
2. **Use the feedback system** to verify changes immediately
3. **The app remembers** your custom hotkey between launches
4. **Visual feedback** appears even without clipboard content

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 required)
- Xcode 16.0 or later
- [Osaurus](https://github.com/dinoki-ai/osaurus) - Local LLM server (see Prerequisites above)
- Accessibility permission (for hotkey functionality)

## Usage

Deadâ€‘simple workflow:

1. **Copy any text**: Select and copy from anywhere (email, docs, chat, code).
2. **Press your hotkey**: `Control+T` opens the Quick Actions HUD.
3. **Get polished text**: Press `1`â€“`4` (or click) to apply â€” Tweaks streams and pastes the result, then restores your original clipboard.

### Quick Actions HUD

- Press `Control+T` to show a compact HUD with up to 4 slots.
- Press digit keys `1`â€“`4` (or click) to pick an action without leaving your app.
- Configure titles, descriptions, and the underlying system prompts in Settings â†’ Quick Actions.

Behavior details:

- Tweaks copies your current selection (when possible), sends it to your configured AI endpoint, and streams results into your clipboard.
- It presses `Cmd+V` for you to paste in the foreground app as deltas arrive, then restores your original clipboard shortly after.
- If the AI call fails, Tweaks falls back to pasting your original clipboard unchanged.

### Hotkey

- **Default: `Control+T`** â€“ Opens the Quick Actions HUD
- Change it in the Settings tab by clicking "Change" and pressing your desired combination
- While recording, the current hotkey is temporarily suspended to avoid accidental triggers

### Privacy

- All keyboard events require Accessibility permission
- Your text is sent only to the endpoint you configure (local by default)

### AI internals

- `Osaurus.Defaults` sets default `model`, `systemPrompt`, and `temperature`.
- `TweakService` streams deltas and pastes as they arrive for minimal perceived latency.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To get started:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Build locally and verify the hotkey, HUD, and streaming paste work.
3. Run through the onboarding (Accessibility) if youâ€™re on a new debug build.
4. Follow the projectâ€™s Swift style and keep code readable and wellâ€‘named.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description and screenshots/GIFs where helpful.

Guidelines:

- Keep features focused and composable.
- Avoid catching errors silently; handle or surface meaningful context.
- Prefer early returns to deep nesting; keep functions small and intentionâ€‘revealing.
- Update `README.md` and `docs/` as needed (userâ€‘facing changes, notes, appcast if relevant).
- For UI, match the existing `FuturisticUI`/theme components.

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing happens on hotkey

- Ensure Accessibility is granted (open the app â†’ follow the prompt or see the Debug tab)
- Check the visual indicator in the top-right of the popover
- Use "Test Hotkey Now" button to verify functionality
- Ensure no other apps are using the same hotkey combination
- Some apps enable Secure Input and block simulated keystrokes; try another app

### "Permission Required" Won't Go Away

- Ensure you're granting permission to the exact build path
- Try quitting and reopening the app after granting permission
- Use the "Quit & Reopen" button in Debug tab

### Debug Build Path Changed

This happens when Xcode creates a new DerivedData folder:

1. Use the Debug tab's "Setup Accessibility" button
2. It automatically handles the new path

### AI does not change the text

- Verify your server is reachable at `OSAURUS_BASE_URL`
- Check logs in the Xcode console (Debug build prints helpful messages)
- Confirm your endpoint is OpenAI-compatible and returns `choices[0].message.content`

### Privacy

- Your clipboard text is sent to the server you configure. For maximum privacy, use a local server.
